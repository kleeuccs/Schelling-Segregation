# Schelling-Segregation

Project from class: Networks, Crowds, and Markets using textbook with the same name.

The book for the class can be found at:

This attempts to create the Schelling Segregation model using Java code with the Swing library to represent each cell as a Java Button.

Import the code into your favorite IDE and build.  You may have to modify your build path to find all of the class files after they have been compiled.

This has been tested in Eclipse and IntelliJ.  The code work on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
